# ðŸ§© Design Document: Scalable & Secure Observability Stack on Kubernetes

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the design of a scalable and secure observability stack on Kubernetes.

The primary goal is to **centralize logging and monitoring** across multiple workloads and namespaces using popular open-source tools. It emphasizes **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)** principles and supports **GitOps-based automation**.

---

## 2. Architecture

### Core Components:

- **Prometheus**: For metrics scraping and alerting.
- **Grafana**: For metrics and log visualization.
- **Loki**: For centralized log aggregation.
- **Fluent Bit**: Lightweight, resource-efficient log forwarder.
- **RBAC & Network Policies**: For access control and traffic restrictions.

All components are deployed into a dedicated namespace: `observability`.

**Deployment Tooling**: Helm charts (modular and scalable), optionally managed by ArgoCD (GitOps).

---

## 3. Scalability

- **Prometheus**:
  - Configured with TSDB retention and persistent volume settings.
  - Scales vertically or via sharding/federation in larger clusters.

- **Loki**:
  - Horizontal scaling supported using `boltdb-shipper` mode.
  - Object storage backend support for log volume growth.

- **Fluent Bit**:
  - Deployed as a **DaemonSet** to collect logs from all Kubernetes nodes.

- **Grafana**:
  - Supports multi-tenancy using folders and access policies.
  - Custom dashboards can be provisioned per team/project.

---

## 4. Security

- **RBAC**:
  - RoleBindings and Roles ensure scoped access to metrics/logs by namespace or team.

- **TLS**:
  - Enabled for ingress endpoints (e.g., Grafana, Prometheus) using `cert-manager`.

- **Network Policies**:
  - Restrict cross-namespace traffic.
  - Only allow observability namespace to be accessed by authorized components.

- **Authentication**:
  - Grafana is protected via admin credentials.
  - SSO or LDAP integration supported for enterprise environments.

## 5. Trade-offs and Assumptions

| Area            | Assumption/Trade-off |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Metrics         | Prometheus uses a **pull model**. Services must expose `/metrics` endpoints. |
| Log Retention   | Default is 7 days (adjustable). |
| Log Parsing     | Fluent Bit handles basic routing. Complex parsing offloaded to Fluentd or Logstash if needed. |
| Grafana         | OSS Grafana has limited strict multi-tenancy; use Grafana Enterprise or separate instances in prod. |

---

## 6. Production-Readiness & Evolution

- **GitOps Compatibility**:
  - All Helm charts and manifests are ArgoCD-compatible.
  - Declarative deployments via Git repo.

- **High Availability**:
  - In production, run Prometheus, Loki, and Alertmanager in HA mode.

- **Storage Strategy**:
  - Persistent Volumes (PV) for Prometheus and Loki.
  - S3-compatible object storage for long-term Loki logs.

- **Alert Routing**:
  - Alertmanager integrated with email, Slack, PagerDuty, or Webhooks.

- **Cluster Health Monitoring**:
  - Use `node-exporter`, `kube-state-metrics`, and prebuilt dashboards to observe infrastructure.

## âœ… Conclusion

This design enables scalable, secure, and maintainable observability for Kubernetes workloads. It balances open-source flexibility with GitOps automation and production-grade extensibility.
